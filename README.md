# Personal Portfolio Website 2019

Wanting to showcase my previous and ongoing projects, as well as to introduce me and my journey, I decided to create a 
personal portfolio website from scratch. Through this project, not only was I able to provide a platform as a point of contact but I was also 
able to improve my web development skills in general.
